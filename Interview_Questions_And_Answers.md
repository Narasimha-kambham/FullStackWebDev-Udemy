## 1) What is `SEO`?

**`SEO (Search Engine Optimization)`** is the process of improving a website's visibility in search engine results to attract more organic traffic. It involves optimizing content, structure, and technical elements.

## 2) What is `Lighthouse`?

**`Lighthouse`** is an open-source tool by Google that analyzes and improves the quality of web pages. It provides insights on performance, accessibility, SEO, and more to help optimize websites.

## 3) What are `Core Web Vitals`?

**`Core Web Vitals`** are three key metrics used by Google to measure webpage performance and user experience. They directly impact search rankings and user satisfaction.

These are the 3 key Core Web Vital metrics:

- **`Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)`**: Measures the time taken for the main content to load. A good LCP score is 2.5 seconds or less, ensuring faster load times and a better user experience.

- **`Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)`**: Tracks unexpected layout shifts during page load. A low CLS score means the page is stable, preventing frustrating jumps in content.

- **`Interaction to Next Paint (INP)`**: Evaluates how responsive a page is to user interactions, like clicks or taps. A low INP score ensures quick responses, enhancing usability.

**Optimizing these metrics improves user experience, reduces bounce rates, and boosts search rankings.**

## 4) What is `SVG`?

**`SVG(Scalable Vector Graphics)`** is an image format made from shapes and lines, not pixels like PNGs or JPGs. This means SVGs can be resized to any size without losing quality. They are lightweight, flexible, and easy to style or animate, making them ideal for responsive web design.

## 5) What is the `poster` attribute in HTML?

The **`poster`** attribute specifies an image to be displayed before a video starts playing, providing a preview of the video content.

## 6) What is the `preload` attribute in HTML?

The **`preload`** attribute specifies how the audio file should be loaded when the page loads. It can have the following values:

- **`none`**: No preloading, the audio loads only when the user starts playback.
- **`metadata`**: Only the metadata (duration, info) is preloaded.
- **`auto`**: The entire audio file is preloaded in the background for faster playback.
