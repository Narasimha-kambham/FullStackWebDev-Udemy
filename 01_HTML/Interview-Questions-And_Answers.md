## 3) What are Core Web Vitals?
Core Web Vitals are three key metrics used by Google to measure webpage performance and user experience. They directly impact search rankings and user satisfaction. 

These are the 3 key Core Web Vital metrics:
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures the time taken for the main content to load. A good LCP score is 2.5 seconds or less, ensuring faster load times and a better user experience.

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Tracks unexpected layout shifts during page load. A low CLS score means the page is stable, preventing frustrating jumps in content.

- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Evaluates how responsive a page is to user interactions, like clicks or taps. A low INP score ensures quick responses, enhancing usability.

**Optimizing these metrics improves user experience, reduces bounce rates, and boosts search rankings.**
