So, the browser you see is represented by the window object, which can be divided into a couple of parts.
       1) DOM(Document Object Model): A tree-like structure representing the HTML document (all HTML elements).

       2) BOM(Browser Object Model): A collection of browser-specific objects that facilitate interaction with the browser, such as navigation and history management (e.g., navigator, screen, location).

       3) JavaScript: A programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web content by manipulating the DOM and BOM.

Note: The window object is the global object in a browser that represents the browser window and provides access to the document and browser features in JavaScript.

=> You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document. 

=>  The `async` and `defer` attributes in HTML `<script>` tags optimize script loading and execution, improving webpage performance.

        1. Defer Attribute: Allows scripts to load while the DOM is constructed and executes them in order after parsing, ideal for dependent scripts.
        
        2. Async Attribute: Loads and executes scripts as soon as they finish downloading, independent of DOM parsing, suited for non-dependent scripts like analytics.

    Conclusion -
    Proper use of `async` and `defer` enhances webpage responsiveness and overall user experience.
